# Minter.Rocks

Minter.Rocks is a donation-based project that lets run the NFT collection in a solid contract. Lott Link runs one of its collections on this contract but because of the financial problem of the donation-based project the domain is not registered anymore so Lott Link thinks that runs it's Dapp on Its Server for goods. So We run the Dapp on [Minter.Lott.Link](minter.lott.link) so when the site is down it can be possible to access the contracts throw Dapp.

before we run the collection we Check the contract and we are sure that there is not any security problem on them so be sure about them. every individual can create a free contract on Polygon Network with this Dapp. Add [issue](https://github.com/lott-link/Doc/issues) if you have any problem on using Dapp.
