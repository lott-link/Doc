# Lott Link

## about Lott Link
This project about to launch in Web3 world to make the power decentralize and let crowd have the power, in this manner it try to bring lots of people to gether in this honor it Try Etherum block chain as it main block chain and use Chain link to bring more chain availble. At first it try to make sure both of it partner are doing well so it try to challenge them in the way to verify their honesty. mostly Chain Link that it is not transparent the way it work And it is not possible to run a node sepratily to verify it's honestly.

## Road Map:
instead of All the game we are building previosly, We see that there is need for upgrading contract and varible to be update with Chain Link. They will Update their protocols so we need to update also. at fist we deploy all of our contract immutible but we see that when the protocol update we need some update also. So at in our new approch we decide to run a DAO to be possible for community to upgrade the contracts. This DAO run on Etherume and it will be brige to other chain throw the Chain Link CCIP.

## Naming:

Selecting the Name of the Lott comes from Part of the project that wants to bring **lots** of people together. Smart contracts let people transparently and trustless get-togethers, and by linking these people they get power from these connections. On the other hand, we like the games and games need randomness. So we bring other **T** from the word lottery. We think that every game that has randomness on it starts with the lottery.

## Purpose:

Transparent, decentralized and secure Smart contract that brings Lots of people together to bring Joy and Happiness to the Word.
If you believe in math and also trust in a trustless platform, it is the right place for you.
